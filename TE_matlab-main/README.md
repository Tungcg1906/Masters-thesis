- Codes are adapted to handle data from the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) data sharing initiative at http://doi.org/10.6080/K0PC308P.

- Some functions are updates of analogues belonging of freely available TE toolbox developed by John Beggsâ€™ group (posted at: http://code.google.com/p/transfer-entropy-toolbox/; Ito et al., 2011). These function are targeted as "ITO_TE".

1. Preparation

   Compile the mex file (C program) with gcc or lcc (Matlab default C compiler).



2. Another Spiking Data Format (ASDF)

   Another Spike Data Format is basically cell array of spike timing of each neuron.
   In order to calculate TE correctly, I recommend to use only integer for the timing.
   To ensure that, you can do
   >> asdf = ChangeBinning(asdf, 1);

   Last two cells contains special information of the data.

   asdf{end-1}: Binning size in unit of ms (milisecond). (e.g. 1.2 -> 1.2ms/bin, 10 -> 10ms/bin etc...)
   asdf{end}: Array of number of neurons, number of total bins of the data
     (e.g. [10 300000] -> 10 neurons, 300000 time bins)



3. Functions per context (Please refer to header-help of each function for details)

   * TE Calculation
     - ASDFTE.m: (requires transentmex) delayed higher order TE calculator for ASDF.
     - ASDFTE_perm.m: (requires transentmex) delayed higher order TE calculator for ASDF and ASDF2.

   * Changing Data Format
     - SparseToASDF.m: Convert matrix form of raster to ASDF.

   * ASDF utilities
     - ASDFSubsample.m: Subsample specified neurons from ASDF.
     - ASDFChooseTime.m: Crop a time segment from larger ASDF.
     - ASDFGetfrate.m: Get firing rate (per bin) of all the neurons.
     - ASDFChangeBinning.m: Change binning size of ASDF.

   * Supporting functions (not to be excuted directly)
     - transent.c: Mex file for rapid calculation of TE.
     - transent_perm.c: Mex file for rapid calculation of TE between jittered senders and original receivers.


   File README_FUNCTIONS_MANUAL.txt contains a manual with functions description.
